# PROJECT — <Project name>

<!--
Project manifest template. See standards/06-project-manifest.md.

This is the file a fresh engineer or agent reads first, with no conversation history. It answers
"what is this, and what state is it in" — nothing else in the repository does.

Standard 6 R4: fields representing current project state SHOULD be updated whenever the underlying
state materially changes. At minimum consider Current Status, Current Release Target, Known Risks,
Known Blockers, and Next Recommended Work. A manifest that is only correct on the day it was written
is worse than none, because it is read as current.
